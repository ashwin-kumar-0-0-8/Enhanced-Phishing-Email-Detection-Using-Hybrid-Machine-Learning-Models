# Enhanced Phishing Email Detection Using Hybrid Machine Learning Models

This project implements a two-level stacking ensemble of hybrid machine learning models to detect phishing emails with high accuracy and low false-positive rates. It combines traditional classifiers and ensemble techniques to create an advanced detection system.

## Features
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM with Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and AdaBoost.
- **Meta-Learner**: Utilizes Logistic Regression to stack hybrid models for enhanced accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, False Positive Rate (FPR), and False Negative Rate (FNR).

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Phishing Detection Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/phishing-dataset-for-machine-learning))  
- **Features**: Includes multiple attributes indicative of phishing behavior.
